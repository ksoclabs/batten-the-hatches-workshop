# Batten Down the Hatches! A Cluster Security Journey

In this hands-on workshop, the instructors will dive into the methods used to perform a successful real world Kubernetes security audit. Attendees will learn through instructor-led scenarios how to perform cluster / workload inventory, rapidly assess the security posture of workloads, enforce least privilege for end-users and service accounts, and comply with established compliance standards. Each workshop attendee will be provided with a pre-configured public cloud environment running real-world Kubernetes workloads. The tools and methodologies covered in this workshop will give attendees the real world experience to perform a rapid Kubernetes security posture audit in their own organizationâ€™s clusters.

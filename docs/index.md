# KubeCon NA 2019 CTF

Welcome to the Attacking and Defending Kubernetes Clusters: A Guided Tour Walkthrough Guide, as [presented at KubeCon NA 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdMFTdeAL1s). We'll help you create your own Kubernetes environment so you can follow along as we take on the role of two attacking personas looking to make some money and one defending persona working hard to keep the cluster safe and healthy.
